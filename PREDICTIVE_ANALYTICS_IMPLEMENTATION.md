  - Predicts potential constraint conflicts before they occur
  - Suggests proactive worker allocation adjustments
  - Recommends optimal iteration parameters based on predicted complexity
  - Generates early warning indicators for critical periods
  - Performance impact analysis and risk assessment

### 4. Main Analytics Engine (`predictive_analytics.py`)
- **PredictiveAnalyticsEngine** orchestrates all predictive capabilities:
  - Comprehensive insight generation and recommendations
  - System performance monitoring and capability assessment
  - Integration with existing scheduler workflows
  - Configuration management and feature toggles
  - Smart learning system with feedback loops

### 5. Analytics Dashboard Integration (`analytics_widgets.py`)
- Complete Kivy UI components for predictive analytics:
  - **PredictiveAnalyticsDashboard** with tabbed interface
  - Real-time metrics display with key performance indicators
  - Interactive forecast charts and visualization
  - Optimization recommendations with priority levels
  - Historical data trends and analysis
  - Early warning system with severity indicators
  - Settings management and configuration controls

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Principles
- **Minimal Changes**: Existing code remains largely unchanged
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved  
- **Optional Integration**: Predictive features can be enabled/disabled

# Generate forecasts
result = scheduler.generate_demand_forecasts(30)
if result['success']:
    forecasts = result['forecasts']
    print(f"Methods used: {forecasts['metadata']['methods_used']}")

# Run optimization analysis  
opt_result = scheduler.run_predictive_optimization()
if opt_result['success']:
    recommendations = opt_result['optimization_results']['optimization_recommendations']
